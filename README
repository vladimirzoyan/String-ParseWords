String::ParseWords is designed to parse logical words from a
string. Logical words are defined as sets of characters between
double quotes or sets of characters between whitespace.

One practical use for this module is to break apart group names
for authorization within apache 'require' directives.

See ParseWords.pm pod for detailed documentation.
