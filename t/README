Self test suite for the ParseWords module
-----------------------------------------

Tests are invoked by running the ./TEST script, but usually you
run the tests with "make test" at the top directory.  Use -v
option for verbose tests.  You might run an individual test like
this:

  ./TEST -v base/standard

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST base
